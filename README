This is a Git relocation of the SVN repository of the PECL Solr module by Israel Ekpo.
All credits belong to him.

There is additionally a new branch (`solr4-compatible`) that deals with a compatibility issue with Solr 4.0.0.

* The `waitFlush` parameter is deprecated (solr 4)

DISCLAIMER:

I am not the original author of the module and my grasp of C is weak at best. 
I just tweaked the code to suit my needs. I offer no guarantee nor do I take responsibility for any possible loss of functionality you would suffer using this modified code.
